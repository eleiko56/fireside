        <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
        <p>And the cats went out to play...</p>
        <p>It was a night fitting for an M.R. James story</p>
        <p>Everybody was feeling mischievous</p>
        <p>The trees were creaking and the frogs were croacking.</p>
        <p>So they pulled out their marauder's map!</p>
